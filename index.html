        My name is Orion Holcomb, and I was born in Lansing, Michigan where I
        didn't do very much before moving away from my homeland. At about 6
        years old, me and my family moved out to Los Angeles, California and I
        pretty much grew up all my life around there. In the southern parts of
        Cali there happened to be an abundance of mexican immigrants, so I grew
        up eating conchas for breakfast and tamales for dinner. Over the years I
        began to develop a rather large imagination and I grew up writing
        stories and creating entire worlds inside my head and on paper. By the
        time I graduated middle school, we moved again.

        In 9th grade I moved to Georgia, where I grew to love gaming! Every
        single day I would get home, drop my bags, and play games until I passed
        out. This made it very hard for me to socialize and complete important
        work, which really did a number on my relationship with my mother as
        well. I learned to manage my time and to be able to communicate with
        others, as this was a huge challenge for me in the 10th grade. One day,
        something clicked.

      <p class="font-italic">
        In the summer of 10th and 11th grade, I began to grow as a person more
        than I ever had before. I had to deal with summer school and it made me
        realize that I'm not invulnerable to inevitable progress and that it's
        time to become ready for my future life post-graduation. I started
        looking for colleges, but I couldn't find anything that stood out for
        me. After searching long and hard I thought about pursuing the one thing
        I love the most. What if instead of wasting my time gaming, I could make
        it my career? So I decided to pursue it, and nobody could stop me. Here
        I stand with my portfolio, which continues to grow each day as I
        complete new assignments and personal projects. The future is what I
        make of it.
